# How to Code (edX courses)

Some chosen examples of How to Code courses (Simple and Complex Data) on edX by University of British Columbia.

The two courses are part of the MicroSeries on edX --> [Software Development](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/software-development)

The course is taught using a functional programming language (Racket). Its syntax is very easy and you can digest the concepts explained in the course way much better. 

all the files must be opened in DrRacket environment only.

## Final Project

I had the opportunity to create a simple project that mimics the classic Space Invaders game. 

Open `space-invaders.rkt` and type (main G0)
